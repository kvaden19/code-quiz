## TODOS:
### HTML

### CSS
- Second cut - make it "clean and polished"

### JAVASCRIPT
- Create DOM variables
- Create score variables
- Create question objects
    - They will have question, options 1-4, and answer
    - Format, put in array, set up answers as buttons
- Event listener on start button and gamePlay function
    - Start a 30 second countdown timer
    - While (timer or question array hasn't reached zero)
        - Show user a random question
        - If correct button is clicked, points++ and show "Correct!"; else take off 10 seconds and show "Sorry!"
- Give user an input for initials and save object (initials, score) in localStorage
- Create high score table -- how would I show a bunch of objects sorted by an attribute?
    - Put in a couple dummy scores

- Content
    - Create / find 10 JS multiple choice questions

Estimate:
* Set up DOM vars, score vars, and question objects (dummy data)
* gamePlay()
* high score table
* content creation
* Polish CSS
